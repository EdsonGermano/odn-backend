# ODN API

The ODN REST API exposes public data, often continuosly updated and enhanced, from many thousands of public 
government and non profit agencies. 

Much of this data originating from independent sources is fused together to create new, and often 
powerful, entity level data. The API, in addition to search and autosuggest capabilities for finding datasets, 
enables data based comparisons across geographical regions such as states, counties, metropolitan areas, 
cities and zip codes using highly vetted data providers such as US Census, BEA, HUD and others. Comparison data
is preformatted for easy and efficient display on a chart, graph or interactive map.

The API also exposes data organized by narrative style questions a human might ask. The questions can 
be rapidly found using an autosuggest style index, and then used to directly access all data needed to 
thoroughly and authoritatively answer the question. Retrieved data includes time series (temporally aligned), 
tabular, map heavy (includes spatial boundaries), and auto generated unstructured descriptive text.

The ODN API does not duplicate API endpoints or services provided by public sector agencies, but rather, 
returns context relevant pre-populated REST URLs, when appropriate, so the caller can access data 
directly from the source.

The [open source](http://github.com/socrata/odn-backend) API powers [OpenDataNetwork.com]
(http://OpenDataNetwork.com), an [open source](http://github.com/socrata/opendatanetwork.com) 
site; the site highlights myriad uses and provides API badges with contextually relevant API example 
REST endpoints and documentation pointers.

Finally, we continuosly add new data sources which appear automatically in the API, so if your favorite data
source is not available, check back soon. You can also join us [HERE](http://www.opendatanetwork.com/join-open-data-network) 
and receive updates or let us know which data sources you are most interested in.

## App Tokens

Registering for and including a [Socrata application token](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html)
is _required_ for the ODN API. They can be passed either using the `app_token` parameter
or the `X-App-Token` HTTP header.

## Suggestions [/suggest/v1/{type}{?query}{?limit}{?app_token}]

Suggests entities like geographical regions, questions, datasets, publishers and categories
that match the given query prefix or full phrase. Useful for building autosuggest style query
interaction where suggestions are provided as a user types.

+ Parameters

        Type of the object to find.

        + Values
            + `entity`

## Data Values [/data/v1/values{?variable}{?entity_id}{?constraint}{?forecast}{?describe}{?format}{?app_token}]

Retrieve the values for available data about entities.

+ Parameters

    + variable (required, string, `demographics.population.count`)

        Comma separated list of variable IDs.
        Defaults to retrieving all variables.
        It is also possible to pass in a topic such as
        `demographics`, or a dataset such as `demographics.population`,
        which would both be equivalent to specifying
        `demographics.population.count` and `demographics.population.change`.
        Note that only variables in the same dataset are allowed.

    + entity_id (optional, string, `0100000US,0400000US53`)

        Comma separated list of entity IDs.
        Defaults to retrieving all entities.
        Note that since there is currently no results pagination,
        retrieving values for all entities may produce incomplete results.

    + constraint (optional, string)

        To retrieve values for multiple variables, values must be specified
        for every constraint in the dataset. For example, to get all of the variables
        in the `jobs.occupations` dataset, we would need to specify values
        for both `year` and `occupation` by setting passing `year=2013` and
        `occupation=Engineering`.

    + forecast (optional, number)

        Number of steps to forecast.
        Must be an integer between 0 and 20.
        Forecasts are produced using linear extrapolation
        on the data. They are only available when retrieving
        data for a single variable across many numerical
        constraint options.

        + Default `0`

    + describe (optional, boolean)

        Whether or not to produce a description of the data.
        Set to `true` to produce a description.
        Descriptions are not available if no entities are specified.

        + Default `false`

    + format (optional, string)

        If format is set to `google`, the data frame will be formatted
        as a [Google Visualizations data table](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference#datatable-class).
        If the format is not provided or invalid, then the frame
        will be formatted normally.

        + Values
            + `google`

    + app_token (optional, string, `cQovpGcdUT1CSzgYk0KPYdAI0`)

        The [Socrata App Token](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html) to be
        used with your request. The `app_token` parameter is required if an app token is not passed via the `X-App-Token` HTTP header. Clients must [register for their own app tokens](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html).

## Map Creation [/data/v1/map/new{?variable}{?entity_id}{?constraint}{?app_token}]

Create a new map representing the specified geographical entities.
Returns a bounding box containing the given entities geographical boundaries,
summary statistics of the variable across all entities of the same type (e.g.
states, counties, etc.), and a session ID used to efficiently retrieve map
data. Note: session IDs expire after 24 hours.

+ Parameters

    + variable (required, string, `demographics.population.count`)

        A single variable ID.

    + entity_id (required, string, `0400000US53,0400000US08`)

        A comma separated list of entity IDs.
        Entities must have the same type and represent geographical regions.

    + constraint (optional, string)

        Values must be specified for each constraint in the dataset.
        For example, to generate map data for `demographics.population.count`,
        you must specify a value for `year` by passing `year=2013`.

    + app_token (optional, string, `cQovpGcdUT1CSzgYk0KPYdAI0`)

        The [Socrata App Token](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html) to be
        used with your request. The `app_token` parameter is required if an app token is not passed via the `X-App-Token` HTTP header. Clients must [register for their own app tokens](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html).

## Map Data [/data/v1/map/values{?session_id}{?bounds}{?zoom_level}{?app_token}]

Retrieves GeoJSON map data including variable values and polygon boundaries for geographical
regions like states, counties, cities, or zip codes.

This endpoint is also available through [websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).
After creating a map, connect to this endpoint using `ws` instead of `http`.
To get values, send a JSON message with the same parameters as the HTTP endpoint.
If the request was malformed, the server will send back a JSON object with the
`type` field set to `error`.
If the request was successful, the server will send a series of JSON objects in
the same form as the HTTP endpoint.
Check out a reference websocket implementation [here](http://jsfiddle.net/w4nxL46m/64/).

+ Parameters

    + session_id (required, string)

        Unique session ID from the `map/new` endpoint.
        Used to track previously sent data for increased efficiency.

    + zoom_level (required, number, `2`)

        Zoom level of the map.
        Geometries are automatically simplified based on this zoom level.

    + bounds (optional, string, `47.5998951,-122.33707,47.5942794,-122.3270522`)

        Comma separated bounds of the area to search in the following order:
        + latitude of NW point
        + longitude of NW point
        + latitude of SE point
        + longitude of SE point

    + app_token (optional, string, `cQovpGcdUT1CSzgYk0KPYdAI0`)

        The [Socrata App Token](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html) to be
        used with your request. The `app_token` parameter is required if an app token is not passed via the `X-App-Token` HTTP header. Clients must [register for their own app tokens](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html).
